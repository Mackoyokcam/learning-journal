# LJ Code 201 - Day 4

Today we went through pair programming in the lab and it was great. There were a lot of opportunities
to discuss coding with each other as well as learn a thing or two from each others codes. The process went very smoothly
and great improvements were made. We understood how functions work as well as it's purpose for reusability of code.
