# LJ Code 201 - Day 17

 - Today was day 2 of project week and we were firing on all cylinders. CSS and javascript portions of the project
 were getting done asynchronously and everyone was enjoying doing it. We used a mixture of solo and pair programming
 depending on the difficulty of the issues. The project is definitely coming together.
