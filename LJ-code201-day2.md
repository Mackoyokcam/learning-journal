# LJ Code 201 - Day 1

Again today covered things I mostly already understood to an extent. I however finally learned the difference between HTML5 and older versions.
Who knew semantics could be so important. I was one of the people that used
divs with ids to create my entire websites and never knew how it affected
things such as SEO.

It was also great to cover process and design. There are always different methods from successful programmers on how to approach designing a website. I believe the methods in the book are a great way to handle it.
